# cpp11naiveols

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cpp11dummyols is to show how to use cpp11 and solve a specific Linear Algebra problem, which is to obtain the OLS estimator, in the most naive way Use this only for elemental examples, not for actual estimation. There is a good explanation about why R's lm() function uses a QR decomposition instead of a naive computation of the form (X'X)-1(X'Y) as I did here. See http://madrury.github.io/jekyll/update/statistics/2016/07/20/lm-in-R.html.

This dummy package is a part of one of my [blog posts](https://pacha.dev/blog/2023/05/21/r-package-with-c-code-ubuntu/) where I explain step by step how to create an R package with C++ code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cpp11dummyols like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp11dummyols")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(cpp11naiveols)

# estimate the model mpg = intercept + slope * wt + error

X <- matrix(1, nrow = nrow(mtcars), ncol = 2)
X[, 2] <- mtcars$wt

Y <- matrix(mtcars$mpg, nrow = nrow(mtcars), ncol = 1)

cpp11_naive_ols(X, Y)
```

Now let's compare with the `lm()` function from R:

```{r}
coef(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))
```
